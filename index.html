								<h2><a href="#"> Michael Allen <br />
</a></h2>																Introduction 
									<p>My name is Michael, I am in my final semester at Arizona State University. My studies have been focused in the area of Criminology. I previously obtained degrees in Criminal Justice and Fire Science. Having worked as a Police officer and also in emergency services as a Firefighter I have witnessed firsthand what the erosion of the relationships between society, the government, and those working as agents of the government. The result is an overall negative impact on quality of life for mankind.  
										This portfolio project is a culmination of three distinct assignments. First is an argument analysis reviewing Hsin-Wen Lee’s paper, “Taking Deterrence Seriously: The Wide-Scope Deterrence Theory of Punishment”. Second is the review of a Podcast. The Criminals Podcast episode 177, entitled “Palace of Justice” recounts events from trials that took place after WWII. Benjamin Ferencz, assigned to a U.S. war crimes branch of the Army during that time period investigated cases that involved the killing of American prisoners of war by German soldiers. The review of the podcast draws upon sentiments expressed in Jami Anderson’s paper, “Understanding Punishment as an Annulment”. Last is an assignment called protest perspectives. This assignment focuses on civil disobedience. The justification of civil disobedience is argued, using recent events in the middle east as a backdrop. Several inferences are made and supported by excerpts from Kimberly Brownlee’s paper, “The Communicative aspect of Civil Disobedience and Lawful Punishment”.   
										The components of this portfolio represent views discussed and analyzed during this Philosophy of Law course. Although I was expecting something different out of this course the assignments represented in this portfolio were thought provoking. The views of the various authors were and are still noteworthy, as the issues discussed and further theorized are still relevant to society as a whole. 
										The process of developing this portfolio was difficult for me in some regards. I always envisioned philosophy in the sense of reading, reflecting, then giving an account of that reflection. These projects forced me to incorporate the reflections of others in my analysis. The difficult part came into play when I didn’t necessarily agree with the authors premise. Having to defend their points with theories I didn’t believe in proved to be difficult.

									</ul>Society need not respond to criminal infractions by solely inflicting harsh punitive measures on those deemed guilty as a means of deterrence. Lee makes several assertions as to why this is true in her project. The following analysis will attempt to convey this message using excerpt from Lee’s, “Taking Deterrence Seriously: The Wide-Scope Deterrence Theory of Punishment” and supporting passages from Walkers, “Restorative Justice and Reparations”.
									Scholarly criminal deterrence literature, notes three elements. These elements combined yield a sort of cost analysis related to punishment for the actor. They are as follows; the probability of arrest, the probability of being convicted, and the severity of the punishment one stands to receive as a result.
									In theory, deterrence prevents crime by creating a level of fear or respect, however one may see it in the would be criminal and the law-abiding citizens. The types of deterrence are generally referred to as general and specific. General deterrence encompasses society as a whole, while Specific deterrence applies to an individual engaging in criminal behavior.
									Theoretically, when society is made aware of the punishment a convict receives, law-abiding members of society are less likely to commit similar infractions. This is the result of fear stemming from the punishment the convict is sentenced to endure. In regard to the convict, punitive measures, theoretically make them less likely to reoffend as a result of fear of similar or worse sanctions. 
									In “Taking Deterrence Seriously: The Wide-Scope Deterrence Theory of Punishment” Hsin-Wen Lee, asserts that the criminal justice system is morally justified in punishing criminals. Lee believes that the purpose of punishment is deterrence. The fear of external sanction serves as an incentive in the deterrence of crime. As a result, the deterrence theory is frequently associated with disproportionate forms of harsh punishment. 
									In Lee’s work, she addresses what she considers to be a more plausible form of deterrence theory. This theory, the wide-scope theory, embraces ideology in support of, making the best use of all the deterrence tools available, including both external and internal sanctions. Through her analysis, the concept of deep deterrence theory emerges. (Lee, p.1) 
									Deep deterrence theory, based somewhat on early Confucian tradition, asserts that internal sanctions should be favored as opposed to external. (Lee, p.18). The theory explores how internal sanctions are more effective tools in the deterrence of crime. It also expresses the need for policy not to interfere with concepts of liberalism’s respect for neutrality. "Imposition of treatment and education programs, provision of key social resources including basic social welfare and equal opportunity, strengthening crime-solving skills and technology, and inculcating a sense of honor and self-respect among citizens", as a way to deter those other people in society. (Lee, p.17) By utilizing the other resources available to us the system may be able to appeal to potential criminals.
									This passage outlining Walker’s perspective on corrective measures used by the justice system supports Lee’s sentiment related to the need for policy not to interfere with concepts of liberalism’s respect for neutrality. "Corrective justice uses its moral baseline to identify and attach obligations of repair to faulty performance under the standards, not to faulty standards." (Walker, p. 381). Walker is explaining that corrective justice is not the means to an end. It does not remedy the rules already in play. This is an example of policy in some instances creating difficulties in tackling the issue at hand. 
									Some may object, citing the traditional theories of deterrence. Lee makes mention of traditional theories of deterrence having a, “narrow scope” and being “shallow”. I believe this is mainly due to the belief that the only tool of deterrence they offer is fear of punishment. Lee states, “traditional deterrence theories are shallow they assume that only the fear of punishment deters human beings from committing criminal offense.” (Lee, p. 3) I agree, traditional deterrence theory would have us negate the fact that the majority of society, being law-abiding citizens, are such for other reasons other than fear of punishment. Morality, although widely debated is one characteristic that comes to mind. 
									Other objections to the aforementioned may rest in societies perceived inability to accept a shift in deterrence. Lee asserts a belief that, “human beings are capable of entertaining both prudential and non-prudential moral reasons.” Continuing her argument, she expresses that it is reasonable to believe that expansion in the realm of criminal deterrence is plausible simply by, “exploring other sources of reasons and values.” (Lee, p.3).
									As previously mentioned, the basis for all of these assumptions resides within the ideology of early Confucianism. (Lee, p.18) Lee hopes to develop a deterrence theory, “that is deep and use it to expand the scope of useful deterrents.” (Lee, p.3). Lee’s deep deterrence theory holds, “that society may deter criminal offenses by appealing to a person’s sense of honor and/or self-respect.” (Lee, p.3). Lee states, "In civilized societies, most people belong to category (A)" (Lee, p.12) meaning most people belong to the populous that abides by the law. From this we can infer that Lee’s deep theory of deterrence should work. The example is provided for us in the prison population compared to free society. (Wagner).
									The resounding sentiment drawn here is centralized in section V of Lee’s article. (Lee, p. 18). Here she further explains her deep deterrence theory of punishment. The premise being that we may deter criminals from offending by providing reasons based in morality that paint criminal offenses in a negative light. Strict punitive measures are no longer the ends to a means. Instead, the deep theory relies on educational and rehabilitative action to assist offenders in not reoffending. Lee's asserts that potential criminals are rational and thus capable of taking into consideration consequences of their actions, because if this, punitive measures are intended to provide those potential criminals a reason not to commit crimes. (Lee, p.4) 
									In, “Restorative Justice and Reparations” Walker asserts her belief, "Conceptions of corrective justice as a moral ideal suppose a moral baseline of acceptable conduct or due care and regard for the security, dignity, or well-being of others" (Walker, p.378). I believe this excerpt ties into Lee’s assertion of the benefit of appealing to potential criminals’ moral baseline and using resources to build upon it.  
									Walker goes on to write, "The direct concern of restorative justice is the moral quality of future relations between those who have done, allowed, or benefited from wrong and those harmed, deprived, or insulted by it." (Walker, p.385). This excerpt ones again gives credence to Lee’s claim that the utilization of tools other than harsh punitive measures can benefit both the potential or passed criminal and society as a deterrent.  
									The assertions in Lee’s project coupled with themes from Walkers writing present assumptions regarding the state of the justice system and the benefit of varied approaches. Understanding the current culture related to deterrence and punishment is essential. Beyond that baseline, assessing the effectiveness of the old guard and willingness to innovate for the betterment of society is necessary.

									</ul>The Criminals Podcast episode 177, “Palace of Justice” recounts the experience of Benjamin Ferencz who was assigned to a U.S. war crimes branch of the Army during WWII. Ferencz mostly investigated cases that involved the killing of American prisoners of war by German soldiers. His most notable assignment was to seize all the records that could be found in German concentration camps. This was evidentiary collecting would be the beginning of what would become know as the Nuremberg trials.
									Guilt of the parties involved had for all intents and purposes been assumed. Ferencz was ordered to go to Berlin in search of Nazi archives. In these archives, he hoped to find evidence of crimes committed by high-ranking Nazi leaders, doctors, lawyers, and prominent businessmen. “So, we want to put the doctors on trial for medical experiments, we want to put the lawyers on for perverting the law, we want to put the SS on for mass murder, we want to put the foreign ministers on trial for trying to hoodwink the rest of the world.” (Ferencz, 2018).
									The evidence Ferencz found lead to him being assigned to be the chief prosecutor for the Einsatzgruppen case. During this case he had tough decisions to make. He chose to prosecute high ranking individuals, “Because responsibility begins at the top, it doesn't begin at the bottom.” (Ferencz, 2018).
									Ferencz decision and explanation of his decision show how the retributivist theory of punishment operates in practice but mainly asserts that the theory should be rejected. First, we must examine Ferencz thought process while prosecuting the twenty-two individuals he selected to prosecute. His opening statement, “This was a tragic fulfilment of a program of intolerance and arrogance. Vengeance is not our goal, nor do we seek merely a just retribution. We ask this court to affirm, by international penal action, man's right to live in peace and dignity regardless of his race or creed. The case we present is a plea of humanity to law.” (Ferencz, 1947).
									In the second sentence, Ferencz states that the goal of the prosecution is not vengeance or merely just retribution. He called on the court to declare and uphold, “man’s right to live in peace and dignity” (Ferencz, 1947). This a direct rejection of the retributivist theory of punishment. However, at the same time Ferencz, seemingly attempts to assert the need to revalidate the victims’ right to live in peace and dignity, which parallels the retributivist theory of punishment. 
									The case resulted in one defendant being released after being granted time served, two defendant’s receiving life in prison, five receiving sentences ranging between 10 and 20 years and fourteen of them were sentenced to death. According to the confines of the retributivist theory of punishment, the variances in punishment would prove the system unjust. All of the defendants were found culpable; however, their status and rank were different. “In failing to fit the punishment to the criminal will (but instead favoring the wealthy or scapegoating the racially oppressed), we are destroying the criminal justice system's capacity to annul wrongs and validate rights” (Anderson, 224). 
									This draws several questions, was Ferencz plea not heard, were the victims right to life never truly validated, did the international penal system fail? According to the retributivist theory of punishment, all culpable parties, deserve the same punishment for the crimes committed from a moral standpoint. Ferencz could argue that justice was not served based upon the aforementioned. Ferencz also did not asked for the death penalty. The following is an excerpt from the podcast, “And I didn't ask for the death penalty. I gave it very deep thought, what am I going to ask for? You got these 22 guys there, they have murdered over a million people, there's no question about their guilt. Should you chop them up into a million pieces and feed them to the dogs? I said, that would be ridiculous. Just hang them and shoot them, take them out and have a public display. I said, no, it would be ridiculous, still. I said, if you want to have any meaning to this trial, we have to be aware, first, that the victims were slaughtered because they didn't share the race, the religion, or the ideology of their executioners. I said, if I could turn that around and make it a crime to kill somebody because he doesn't share your race, your color, or your political persuasion, if you can get that a crime against humanity, if you can get that out, then you will protect future generations, at least to some extent, and it will be worthwhile and more meaningful than what you do with these 22 murderers.” (Ferencz, 2018).
									He recounts having a somber reaction after the verdict and sentencing were delivered. As previously mentioned, the prosecution was not seeking vengeance but a revalidation of the lives lost. Ferencz was pleading for change not retribution. The Einsatzgruppen case met all but one condition for punishment under the retributivist theory of punishment, consistency. “Punishment annuls wrong only if three conditions are met: (1) punishment is a public practice, (2) punishment is a consistent practice, and (3) punishment is painful” (Anderson, 219). 
									The fact that Ferencz did not feel his mission had been accomplished in revalidating the victims lives despite the worldwide coverage of the case, painful, and public punishment, reaffirms a rejection of the retributivist theory of punishment. Even in this example of punishment operating in practice the ultimate goal was not accomplished. The verdict failing to bring light to the bigger issue, in Ferencz eyes, was a failure of the international penal system. That failure negates the inconsistency in punishment and affirms the rejection of this theory.

									The Iranian President, Ebrahim Raisi has been in the news recently attempting to allay public outrage aimed at the country's rulers. Anti-governmental regime protests have spread for weeks across university and high school campuses. The protest was sparked by grievances related to the handling of the death of a young woman being held in the custody by Islamic religious police for not adhering to the countries dress code. The United States and Israel, are being accused of inciting the unrest, noted as the most widespread challenge to Iran's leadership in many years. (NPR, 2022). 
I assert that this protest, as it stands is morally justified. The civil disobedience taking place is the result of a populations disdain for government action. The protest occurring are in hopes of conveying to policy makers the dissatisfaction of the citizens, in hopes of reform.  “Condemnation of a certain law or policy and her desire for recognition that a lasting change in policy is required.” (Brownlee, p.1) This fits within the scope of some of the sentiments Brownlee expressed in her work. 
Civil disobedience in a democracy is an interesting concept to examine. We have the freedom to voice our disdain for the government, societal issues, so on and so forth, a right many across the globe do not share. The first amendment protects the right to peaceably assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievance. The parameters have been established and adherence to these standards fall under the rule of law. 
The civil disobedience discussed in the news story above has not risen to the level of wide spread violence or destruction. "Several factors are relevant to the justification of civil disobedience such as, first, how serious, sincere and committed disobedients are in their actions, second, how well-founded their challenges are, and third, how much harm is done or risked through their disobedience" (Brownlee, p.183). This is the dilemma, in a country where freedoms lack tremendously compared to those here in the U.S. the parameters for protesting are seemingly being adhered to. Several accounts of protest turning violent and the destruction of property in the name of “social justice” riddled the screens of our phones, computers, and televisions. How is it that in a society free to petition the government for a redress has crossed the line and tossed policy and procedure to the wind, yet a population in a country with far stricter rules and dire consequences for not following them respectfully toes the line?
Brownlee states in, “The communicative aspects of civil disobedience and lawful punishment”, “In punishing an offender, the state seeks to communicate both its condemnation of the crime committed and its desire for repentance and reformation on the part of the offender. Similarly, in civilly disobeying the law, a disobedient seeks to convey both her condemnation of a certain law or policy and her desire for recognition that a lasting change in policy is required.” (Brownlee, p.1). This excerpt sheds light on the intention of civil disobedience from her perspective. This statement is supported by the actions of the protesters in the article. They disapprove of government action and are voicing it through protest. 
What exactly is civil disobedience then? In my opinion it must possess the following characteristics; Adherence to nonviolence, righteous intention, and an authentic desire to communicate the need for change. History provides us with notable examples of civil disobedience at work. Change has occurred as a result in instances such as the Civil rights movement of the 1960’s and earlier the Boston Tea Party. 
Rosa Parks is a prime example of civil disobedience in play. “Since, as a strategy, coercion is likely to turn policymakers against a position, a disobedient who sincerely aims to have a long-term impact upon policymakers’ views has reason not to force policymakers to adopt her position, but rather rationally to persuade them of the merits of her view and the flaws in the law or policy she opposes.” (Brownlee, p.180). on the other hand, efforts made by Civil rights leaders like Malcolm X, who exercised a more radicalized means to an end were not as well received by governmental bodies. “Too radical a protest could obscure the moral force of her objection. This is a reason to prefer civil disobedience as a strategy to radical disobedience.5 But, it is not a reason to prefer civil disobedience to legal protest. A common challenge to civil disobedience is that those who employ it step unnecessarily outside the proper channels of political participation.” (Brownlee, p.180).
Many oppose civil disobedience, not finding it justifiable, morally or otherwise. Fear of the damage it can produce and the very real threat to the rule of law established under democracy are notable. That being said, if a disobedient acts in a many that voices their disdain, grabs the attention of policy makes, denounces destructive and violent practices, and is open to civil dialogue, change can occur.
